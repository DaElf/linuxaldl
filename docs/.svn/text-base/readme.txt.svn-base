INTRODUCTION
------------
Thank you for downloading linuxaldl from:
http://www.steventsnyder.com/linuxaldl.html

The goal of this project is to develop software that provides
access to the GM ALDL interface over a serial connection from
Unix-based operating systems.

Currently linuxaldl is a GUI application with a basic command line
interface. The command line interface will be improved in a later 
version. For now, all features are supported in the GUI.


HOW TO USE
----------


Compiling linuxaldl
-------------------

You will need the popt and gtk+-2.0 libraries, as well as gcc for compiling
and linking. A makefile is included.

Unzip the contents of of the linuxaldl tar file to any location. Go to
the /src subdirectory from a terminal window, and run make. If all goes well,
the executable will be created with the name "linuxaldl". You can put
this executable wherever you want. There are no additional files required and
linuxaldl does not use temporarily files. 


GUI Operation
-------------
 
To open the linuxaldl GUI use the command:
	linuxaldl -serial=/dev/ttyUSB0
where /dev/ttyUSB0 is the address to your ALDL interface.

If you want to use a launcher shortcut to open the GUI interface, choose
"application in terminal" as the type. Important diagnostic information is
printed to the terminal in the current version. A future version will make this
all part of the GUI.



Command Line Operation
